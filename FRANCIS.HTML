<h1>Overview</h1><br>
<ul>
    <li> <h3>3D Photos and Videos</h3> 
        Apple Vision Pro can record videos and take spatial photos thanks to its 12 cameras and 6 microphones. This allows capturing memories and reliving them later in three dimensions.</li>
<li><h3>Virtual Avatars</h3> 
    With the help of a camera, Apple Vision Pro can create a virtual avatar for making calls or other applications. The avatar can detect the user's facial and eye movements to replicate them and provide greater realism.</li>
<li><h3>3D Meetings with Apple Vision Pro</h3>
    Facetime meetings will also have their own augmented reality version, where avatars can be used. The user can have a meeting, viewing the call participants in separate windows in front of them.</li>
<li><h3>EyeSight</h3>When the user puts on the glasses, an external display can show their eyes to the outside world. This facilitates communication between users of Apple Vision Pro.</li>
